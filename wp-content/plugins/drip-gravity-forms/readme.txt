Integrates Gravity Forms with personalized Email Marketing tool Drip.

== Description ==

Static, one-to-many broadcast email newsletter communication is dying, and **marketing automation is [the future of email marketing](https://www.getdrip.com/blog/email-marketing/why-marketing-automation-is-the-future-of-email-marketing/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=drip-gravity-forms)**.

**Does your current email solution** allow you to _easily send emails to your list based on any action they take_ inside your emails and on your website? Like

* expressing interest in a topic
* downloading a sample chapter of your book
* starting a trial of your software, or
* viewing your upgrade page

Does it _view an email address as a single person_, no matter which “campaign” or “list” they are subscribed to?

Does it give you the ability to _craft your entire user journey in a gorgeous, visual flow_?

Can you use automated lead scoring to _pinpoint your hottest prospects_ and then automatically add them to your favorite CRM software?

Does it _prune your list_ of inactive subscribers so you're not paying more than you need?

If you want to use email to

* **inspire your target customers and earn their trust**
* **transform skeptical users into successful customers**
* **turn successful customers into raving fans who bring new business straight to your door**

_You should try Drip_.

> **[Drip](https://www.getdrip.com)** is lightweight email marketing automation that doesn't suck. It is *the* easiest way to build your email list and send personalized email campaigns to **the right person at** exactly **the right time**.

This plugin makes it dead simple to build your own custom forms with [Gravity Forms](https://rocketgenius.pxf.io/c/1212782/445235/7938), and send data to Drip whenever the form is submitted. _Note: You'll need to have your own copy of **[Gravity Forms](https://rocketgenius.pxf.io/c/1212782/445235/7938)** (any license)_

When a form is submitted, you can
